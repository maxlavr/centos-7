	### 2.1  Change Language and Encoding Temporarily  
		# for a few time (after reboot will change)  
		# you should set value for global param LANG  
		# before print current value

	> echo $LANG

		# to change for rus for example type:  

	> LANG=ru_RU.utf-8  

		# after type to check:  

	> echo $LANG  

	### Change Language and Encoding Permanently  
		# if you donâ€™t want to manually change the language and encoding each time  
		# you connect, you can set the locale on an ongoing basis  
		# edit ./bash_profile and add LANG='value' in
