# This is guide aboute configuration keyborad in centos-7

1. ### Lets talk about 'localectl' and 'locale'  
2. ### Change Language and Encoding (FIRST METHOD)  


### Notice
	I recommended first of all to configure the basic/minimal tools in your system,  
	but you can to do it later. This is your choice, this is your life)  



#### HELPER LINK: [TO INSTALL MINIMAL CENTOS](../minimal/ "FOLLOW THIS LINK TO MINIMAL")  


1. ### Lets talk about 'localectl' and 'locale'  

	#### 1.1 localectl & locale  

		# localectl is util that control system locale and keyboard layout settings  
		# locale is perl programm to use or avoid POSIX locales for built-in operations  

	> man localectl  
	> man locale  

		# the configuration file named locale.conf  

	> man locale.conf  

		# it's located in /etc/locale.conf  
		# to know more about your configuration now type:  

	> locale  
	> locale -v  
	> localectl  

		#output will print some params, you can know about them by follow link  


	#### 1.2 locale

	#### THIS LINK CAN HELP YOU [MAN-LOCALE-OFFICIAL](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/locale.1.en "man locale official")  

		#you need the mean some of 'locale' params (about anothers you can know follow the link):  
		- LANG (LANGUAGE)  
		- LS_MESSAGES (This category affects the language in which messages are displayed and what an affirmative or negative answer looks like)  
		- LC_ALL (All for above)  

		# locale have flags -a | -m  
		# locale -a (--all-locales) display a list of all of available locales (cat /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive)  
		# locale -m (--charmaps) display all of avalable charmaps 

		# for more info:  

	> locale -a -v  

		# infomations of this output located in /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive  

	#### 1.3 localectl  (XKB configuration)

	#### THIS LINK CAN HELP YOU [XKB-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE](https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xorg-docs/input/XKB-Config.html#Basic_Configuration  "XKB Configuration Guide")  

		# localectl may be used to query and change the:  
		# - system locale (the lenguage settings of system services, UI)  
		# - keyboard layout settings (the keyboard layout used on the text console and graphical UI)  

		# the full list of keyboard models /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst

	> cat /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/base.lst

		# config file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  
		
	> cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  

		# The parameters are:

		# XkbRules - files of rules to be used for keyboard mapping composition  

	> ls -l /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules  

		# XkbModel - name of the model of your keyboard type  

	> localectl list-x11-keymap-models  
	> cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  | less  
	> push: / and  print: "! model"  

		# XkbLayout - layout(s) you intend to use  

	> localectl list-x11-keymap-layouts  
	> cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  | less    
	> push: / and  print: "! layouts"    
	
		# XkbVariant - variant(s) of the layout you intend to use  

	> localect list-x11-keymap-variants   
	> cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  | less   
	> push: / and  print: "! variants"    

		# XkbOptions - extra xkb configuration options  

	> localect list-x11-keymap-options  
	> cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf  | less  
	> push: / and  print: "! options"

2. ### Change Language and Encoding (FIRST METHOD)  
	#### 2.1 TEMPORARILY    
		# for a few time (after reboot all settings that you set will change for default)  
		# you should set value for global param LANG  
		# before print current value

	> echo $LANG

		# to change for rus for example type:  

	> LANG=ru_RU.utf-8  

		# after type to check:  

	> echo $LANG  

	#### 2.2 PERMANENTLY  
		# if you donâ€™t want to manually change the language and encoding each time  
		# you connect, you can set the locale on an ongoing basis  
		# edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile and add LANG='value' in  

	> vi ~/.bashrc

		# or

	> vi ~/.profile  

		# add line  

	> LANG=ru_RU.utf-8  

		# The change will take effect the next time you log in,  
		# but you can speed it up by running one of the commands below  

	> source ~/.bashrc  

		# or  

	> source ~/.profile  

	#### 2.3 DEFAULT  
		# Follow these steps to change the default system locale (for all users)  
		
	##### 2.3.1 edit config file

	> vi /etc/locale.conf  

	##### 2.3.2 add some params to file    

	> LANG="ru_RU.utf-8"  
	> LC_MESSAGES="ru_RU.utf-8"

	##### 2.3.1 reload script locale.sh

		# After making changes to the locale.conf files, they will take effect  
		# after a system reboot, or you can use force method and do:  

	> source /etc/profile.d/sh.locale
